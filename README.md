# IneptEngine

Welcome to IneptEngine, a learning project aimed at creating a simple game engine. The goal is to provide a platform for me to experiment with and learn about the basic concepts and technologies involved in game development.

## Features(to come!)
- [ ] Basic graphics engine
- [ ] Limited support for 2D and 3D environments
- [ ] Basic physics simulation
- [ ] Limited audio support
- [ ] Simple scripting language

## Getting Started (Project still in development and is missing key features!)
1. Download IneptEngine from this GitHub repository.
2. Run Build.bat for building with cmake or GenerateSolutions.bat for creating visual studio projects
3. Explore and share your insights!
